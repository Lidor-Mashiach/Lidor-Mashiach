# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub

Hi, I'm Lidor Mashiach — part of the Honors Program at Ben-Gurion University, where I’m pursuing a combined B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Software & Information Systems Engineering, specializing in Machine Learning and Big Data.  

My main focus is on Deep Learning research, but I also enjoy exploring Information Retrieval, Reinforcement Learning, and algorithmic problem-solving.  
I love building projects that bridge theory and practice — from scalable software systems to hands-on ML experiments.
