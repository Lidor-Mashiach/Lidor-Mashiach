# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub

I'm Lidor Mashiach — a Software & Information Systems Engineering student at Ben-Gurion University, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

My interests revolve around intelligent systems, algorithmic thinking, and building software that’s both elegant and scalable.  
I'm currently preparing for M.Sc. research in Deep Learning under academic supervision, and love exploring ideas that bridge theory and practice.
